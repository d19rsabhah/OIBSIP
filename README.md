# Online Reservation System

## This project implements a simple Online Reservation System using Java and MySQL. The system allows users to interact with a MySQL database to perform operations such as inserting new reservation records, deleting existing records, and viewing all reservations. The project comprises two main classes:

### User Class:
#### Manages user authentication with a username and password.
#### Enables secure access to the MySQL database.

### PnrRecord Class:
#### Handles the creation of Passenger Name Record (PNR) entries.
#### Utilizes a random PNR number generator and user input for details such as passenger name, train number, class type, journey date, departure, and destination locations.

### Key Features:
#### User authentication for secure access.
#### Dynamic generation of PNR numbers.
#### CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on reservation records.
#### MySQL database integration for persistent data storage.
#### User-friendly console interface for easy interaction.

## How to Use:
#### Launch the program and enter your username and password.
#### Choose from options: Insert Record, Delete Record, Show All Records, or Exit.
#### Insert Record: Enter details to add a new reservation.
#### Delete Record: Specify the PNR number to delete a reservation.
#### Show All Records: View all reservations stored in the database.

### This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of Java programming, database connectivity, and user interaction in a console-based application. It is designed for educational purposes, showcasing a simplified implementation of a reservation system.
